<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Blake Graviett</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am currently a learning software developer from Cape Girardeau Missouri</h3>

<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
<p align="center">	Hi my name is Blake Graviett and I my dream is to get a degree in Computer Science or some degree related to the tech industry. I have always been interested in technology ever since I was a kid and now have gone as far as building myself a high end computer and taking classes here at the CTC for Coding and Programming. I hope to use the knowledge I gain to get a job in the this industry and field.</p>
	<p align="center">	As a student I have done many things. Like I said before I attend the CTC and am trying to take classes to help me specialize in the field I want to go to.I am also well rounded in different types of classes. I have taken a Informational Technology class, a Advanced Technology class, a Online Technology class (teaching different software's on computers) and many more. I was student of the year in Advanced Technology, Photoshop, and Web Broadcasting my Junior year of High school.</p>
<p align="center">	I am involved in many extracurricular activities some of those are, the main leader of the Sports Casting and Sports Media teams, A officer in FCA (Fellowship of Christan Athletes), and I was a leader on a three day retreat that our school calls Kairos. On this retreat I had to do stuff such as lead a small group discussions, give a thirty-minute speech, and much more. For our sports media and casting teams, I commentate and make a majority of the content for our digital scoreboards. While doing this I am teaching others interested in the club.</p>
	<p align="center">	My interest has always been with technology and this is why I have always wanted to be in a industry involving it. I have been put in positions that require me to step up and get out of comfort zone and I have always excepted the challenge and try my best to tackle ever situation. I have been called into leadership roles and I have always tried to help and teach others the knowledge that I have learned. I am hoping after high school to get my degree and get a job that I have always wanted. </p>
